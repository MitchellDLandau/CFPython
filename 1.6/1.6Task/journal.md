# 1.6: Connecting to Databases in Python

Create a MySQL database for your Recipe app

## Reflection Questions

### What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

Databases are where you can store information that then can be retrieved at a later date. With applications such as python info is stored in volotile storage such as RAM (random access memory) and when the program is exited all of this information is lost. With a database you can put info into long term storage similar to a hard drive so that it can always be accessed. 

### List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:

```INT``` Integers would be storage of a number that does not have any decimal values. 

```FLOAT``` Floats are numbers that do have decimal values. They can mathmatically equal the same as an integer but the computer would represent them with a .0 for their decimal place. 

```VARCHAR ``` Varchars represent variable charactors and usually would represent words and other characters. This is the only MySQL data type that can store words compared to the other data types that deal with numbers. 

###  In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?

SQLite is a means of storing information in an SQL like format without having to setup a full database and the infrastructure that goes along with it. You can store this info in a simple file with the label ```.db```. This type of database is still accessable with languages like Python. This is a great option for small tasks or uncomplicated tasks as it cannot handle more complicated things that MySQL was made for. 

### Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

JavaScript has more capabilities when it comes to being able to decorate things. Java also allows you to import different libraries that can have built in functions and options that can help you as you develop. Python can also import functions and things however due to it living in a volotile environment where you have re enter your commands if your environment is exited it can be a little more cumbersome with larger projects. Though this can be the case it is quite good when dealing with more mathematical equations and functions that JavaScript. 

### Now that youâ€™re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?

So far the limitations that I see are the environment that python is running in and how you work with it. It is not great that the environment has to reload everything that you previously worked on which can limit its usefulness. I do like ```elif``` and ```for``` loops and how they work in terms of flow as you work through a program. I can see Pythons usefulness in smaller applications however I feel it is limmited when it comes to larger projects especially projects that teams would be working on.
