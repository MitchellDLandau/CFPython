## 1.   In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

I would be working on the logic for how information is stored and sent to the front end to display for the user. This would involve conversing with the database and the security involved with this. It would also include functioons to be taken place to secure the information or process it for storage or presentation to the end user. 

## 2.   Imagine youâ€™re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 

Python would be great in an application because of it adaptability with reguards to the handling of its functions and variables. Python is also used because of its readability and how dynamic it is when working on a project. The package management freedom python offers is also great as different versions and options are available and can be used together on different parts of an application. 

## 3.1  What do you want to learn about Python?

I know that python can be used to do many things in the world of programming. I look forward to learning about its use in smaller applications such as automation using Raspberry Pies as well as how it could help with the processing of information. I look forward to building my own recipe application which I started durring my front end course to hopefully automate or help with the processing of hand written recipes. 

##  3.2 What do you want to get out of this Achievement?

I hope that during this acheivement I can get a better understanding of the capabilities of and its best use cases. I know you can design complex robotics and automations however I want to know more about what it is best at. I also look forward to how it can be implimented into applications I look to build in the future. 

## 3.3  Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

After this aceivement I plan to create a recipe application for my family to use. I want it to store all of my families recipes and have a group dynamic so others could create their own "families" that they can invite others to join to see what recipes they have in their group. I also want it to have a grocery and weekly meal prepping portion to be able to allow people to plan their week and their grocery run with the application.
